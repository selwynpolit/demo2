## How to contribute
You are invited to contribute (in the [open source](open_source.md) way) by making edits and pull requests(a fancy way of getting others to review your changes) at [this link on Github](https://github.com/selwynpolit/demo2/tree/gh-pages/book). There is a very simple online editor which automatically forks the repo and lets you type your changes directly in your browser in [markdown format](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Try it by editing a chapter of interest to you. And while you are here, [see who else contributed to theis masterpiece ðŸ˜‰](attribution)

If you are inspired, please be a part of this project by contributing your own thoughts and ideas. ([Imposters](https://events.drupal.org/drupalcon2021/news/youve-got-notes-about-impostor-syndrome) are welcome!) Add your name on the [attribution page](attribution). Either add a note in the comment form at the bottom of each page or click the `Edit this page on GitHub` also at the very bottom of any page and start editing. You don't need to know Git.

If you want to contribute to the expense of creating this book, you can contribute via [Github Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/selwynpolit), [Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/u/selwyn-polit), [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/selwyn) or [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/selwynpolit).  Thanks!
