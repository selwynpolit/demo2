## Basic Needs
Ensuring people’s **basic needs are met** must be a central pillar of Democracy 2.0.  [UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) is  **legally binding** in all Democracy 2.0 jurisdictions. 

### Core Protections for Basic Needs

1. **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**
    - A **guaranteed monthly stipend** to cover essential living costs, ensuring no citizen falls into poverty.
    - Adjusted based on cost-of-living factors, with a supplemental emergency fund for crises.

2. **Universal Healthcare**
    - **Publicly funded healthcare system**, ensuring medical services are free at the point of use.
    - **Private sector collaboration** for additional specialized care without undermining accessibility.

3. **Education as a Right**
    - **Publicly funded higher education** so students aren’t trapped in debt for learning.
    - **Technology-integrated schools** providing modern skills training, including AI literacy.
    - A **national education budget lock**—minimum funding cannot drop below a set percentage of GDP.

4. **Science & Technology Investment**
    - **Government-backed R&D centers** focused on clean energy, AI, and space exploration.
    - **Ethical AI governance** to prevent misuse and ensure equitable benefits.
    - **Mandatory science funding floor** to stop political interference in research budgets.

These policies ensure that **no administration can gut essential services**, keeping power aligned with **human well-being rather than profit motives.**

## Eradicating Racism & Sexism Systemically
1. **Automatic Anti-Discrimination Laws** – No administration can remove protections for marginalized communities—**they’re locked into law permanently**.
2. **Equitable Policy Review Board** – Every new law must go through an **anti-oppression review** to ensure no discriminatory impact.
3. **Guaranteed Equal Representation** – Governing bodies must **mirror population demographics**, meaning no group is excluded from leadership.
4. **Economic Reparations & Wealth Redistribution** – Direct investment in historically oppressed communities, ensuring **true financial equity**.
5. **Bias-Free AI & Hiring Systems** – AI-driven hiring tools must be **transparently monitored** to **eliminate racial and gender bias** in employment.

We’re constructing a **truly people-first future**—one that prevents **wealth-driven oppression and environmental collapse** from ever taking hold again.


## Citizen Veto Power
This is a **direct, digital mechanism** allowing the public to block harmful policies before they take effect. This includes:
- **Real-Time Voting Portal**: A secure, blockchain-backed platform where **citizens vote** on executive decisions.
- **Threshold System**: If a policy reaches a **critical opposition threshold (e.g., 70% disapproval)**, it is automatically nullified.
- **Emergency Veto Option**: Citizens can **fast-track a veto** on extreme policies (such as unlawful deportations or suppression of speech).
- **Inclusivity Measures**: Ensuring **equal access** to voting via smartphone, kiosks, or community centers to avoid disenfranchisement.

This **truly democratizes decision-making**—ensuring executive power remains **answerable to the people in real time.**


## Wealth Limits & Redistribution
1. **Maximum Wealth Cap** – No individual can hoard more than a set limit of $500 million. Once they hit that threshold, excess wealth is **automatically redirected** into public investment funds.
2. **Progressive Asset Redistribution** – Taxes on extreme wealth aren’t just **symbolic**—they function as a **mechanism to prevent power hoarding**. Large estates must **return a portion** to social programs.
3. **Public-Owned Industries** – Key sectors (healthcare, housing, energy) would be **publicly controlled** rather than owned by a handful of tycoons.
