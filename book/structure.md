# Structure of the site

Below is an enhanced organizational layout that not only covers all the major topics we discussed—from human rights, judicial and legislative reforms, data privacy, and open source lawmaking—but also includes a dedicated structure for local communities to contribute their own content and organize citizen groups.

> **Note:** While the previous outline already touches on many topics (e.g., judicial reform, open source legislative processes, economic policy, consumer protection, immigration reform, etc.), this revised structure explicitly emphasizes community contribution and local content while reinforcing every facet of our Democracy 2.0 vision.
