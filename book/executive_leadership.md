## Rotating Executive Leadership Council
Instead of a single president, we have an **Executive Council** made up of **five to seven elected leaders** who rotate leadership duties. Rotation **prevents consolidation of power**, ensuring that leadership remains dynamic and accountable.

- **Monthly Rotation:** Each member serves as the primary executive for a month, ensuring fresh perspectives and preventing authoritarian entrenchment.
- **Weekly Rotation for Crisis Management:** In urgent situations, leadership could rotate weekly so no single individual dominates response strategies.



### **Council Veto Mechanism**
- **Rapid Review Window:** The council gets **48 hours** to veto an executive decision before implementation.
- **Supermajority Rule:** A **â…” vote** of the council would be required to block an action.
- **Public Transparency:** All veto attempts must be publicly recorded, so citizens see when checks are being applied.
- **Emergency Nullification:** If a decision poses **severe harm** (e.g., triggering economic collapse), the council can **override it instantly** with unanimous approval.

### **Removing a Bad Leader from the Council**
- **Citizen Recall Vote:** If a leader violates democratic principles, the public can vote to **remove them** from the council.
- **Automatic Expulsion for Violations:** If a leader **defies court rulings** or engages in **authoritarian behavior**, they are **immediately expelled** and barred from holding office again.
- **Council Suspension Authority:** If a leader becomes dangerously unstable, the council can vote to **temporarily remove** them pending an investigation.
