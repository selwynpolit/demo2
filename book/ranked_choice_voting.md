## What Is Ranked Choice Voting?

**Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)**—sometimes called instant-runoff voting—is an electoral system where voters rank candidates in order of preference rather than voting for a single candidate. This approach replaces the traditional "first-past-the-post" method and is designed to produce outcomes that better reflect the collective preference of the electorate.

## How RCV Works:

1. **Voting Process:**
- **Ranking Choices:** When casting a ballot, each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference (1st choice, 2nd choice, and so on).
- **No Vote Splitting:** Voters are encouraged to express their true preferences without fear that choosing a less-popular candidate will inadvertently help their least-favored candidate win.

2. **Counting Votes:**
- **First Round:** Initially, only first-choice votes are considered. If a candidate secures an outright majority (over 50%), they are declared the winner.
- **Elimination and Redistribution:** If no candidate has a majority:
    - The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.
    - Votes for the eliminated candidate are reallocated to each voter's next preferred candidate.
    - This process continues—a series of elimination rounds with vote redistribution—until one candidate achieves a majority.

3. **Outcome Reflection:**
- **Consensus Winner:** The final winning candidate is one that has broad support across the electorate, not just a plurality of the initial votes.
- **Incentivizing Positive Campaigning:** Because candidates benefit not only from their first-choice support but also from being ranked as a second or third option, they are incentivized to present more moderate, coalition-friendly policies.
