## 

**Democracy 2.0** is deeply rooted in justice and sustainability, so there are hardwired protections for the environment in the system.

## **Environmental Safeguards**
1. **Constitutional Right to a Healthy Planet** – Environmental protection isn’t optional; it’s **legally mandated**. No government can roll back climate laws.
2. **Polluter Accountability Tax** – Corporations causing environmental damage must **pay into restoration funds** rather than passing the cost to taxpayers.
3. **Mandatory Clean Energy Transition** – A hard **deadline for phasing out fossil fuels**, with a **public fund** for developing renewables.
4. **Local Climate Councils** – Every city has a **citizen-led sustainability board** that oversees environmental progress **outside of government control.**
5. **Nature Reparations Fund** – Restoring ecosystems that have been devastated by industrialization, with **automatic funding allocation** protected from political interference.
