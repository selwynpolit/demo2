This is a critical section for localized action, ensuring communities can share their own content and initiatives.

## Community Portal
- **Local Groups Directory:**  
  A searchable catalog where users can find or create pages for local citizen groups.
- **Community Homepages:**  
  Each community or citizen group gets its own portal page to share relevant information, ongoing initiatives, events, and discussions.
- **Template & Guidelines for Starting a Group:**  
  Step-by-step instructions, best practices, and downloadable templates for community organizers to launch and maintain group activities.
- **Aggregation of Local Impact:**  
  Links to community success stories, project listings, and local contributions feeding into the national “Direct Impact Feedback” dashboard.

## Regional Hubs & Collaboration
- **Inter-Community Collaboration Tools:**  
  Forums, wikis, and messaging boards where local groups can collaborate, share ideas, and support joint initiatives.
- **Local Policy Adaptation:**  
  A space within each community page where localized versions of national proposals are discussed, tailored, and reviewed.
- **Event Calendars and Volunteer Opportunities:**  
  Integrated with local community pages to allow citizens to sign up for meetings, hackathons, or public consultations.
