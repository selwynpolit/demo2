## Consumer Protection Measures

**Consumer protection** and **truth enforcement** are essential pillars for Democracy 2.0. Here’s how we could integrate them into the system:

### **Consumer Protection Measures**
1. **Universal Fair Pricing** – Corporations must disclose **true cost breakdowns** so consumers **never** get exploited by hidden fees.
2. **Anti-Monopoly Regulations** – No company can **own more than a set percentage** of its industry, ensuring **competition remains fair**.
3. **Product Safety & Environmental Responsibility** – Companies **must prove** their products meet **health and sustainability** standards before selling.
4. **Automatic Refunds for Fraudulent Practices** – Any company found guilty of deception **must instantly refund all affected consumers**, preventing long legal battles.

### **Truth Accountability for Officials & Corporations**
1. **Public Fact-Checking System** – Politicians & CEOs must submit **public explanations for major decisions**, verified by independent review boards.
2. **Mandatory Truth Pledges** – Officials **must sign legally binding truth agreements**—if they lie, **they face automatic penalties**.
3. **Corporate Truth Enforcement** – Any corporation caught **intentionally misleading the public** loses **government contracts and public funding**.
4. **Criminal Charges for Large-Scale Lies** – If deception leads to **economic damage or harm**, responsible executives or officials **can face legal consequences**.

This would ensure **both governments and corporations remain honest, fair, and transparent**.
