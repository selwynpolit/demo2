## The Problem
**Money in politics** is a root issue. If leaders are beholden to corporate donors or special interests, they’ll always find ways to manipulate the system. A publicly funded political system, combined with strict caps on campaign spending and lobbying, could help ensure leaders are accountable to the people—not their wallets.


Here's a detailed expansion of how Democracy 2.0 can implement robust campaign finance reform and lobbying regulations to ensure that democratic processes serve the people rather than corporate interests:


## Public Campaign Financing

### Core Framework
- **Equal Resource Distribution:**
    - Every qualified candidate receives the same baseline funding
    - Additional matching funds for small-dollar donations from constituents
    - Strict prohibition on personal wealth or corporate funding in campaigns

### Implementation
- **Qualification Requirements:**
    - Demonstrate broad community support through petition signatures
    - Meet basic eligibility criteria (e.g., clean ethics record)
    - Commit to participating exclusively in the public financing system

### Funding Mechanics
- **Base Funding Package:**
    - Fixed amount determined by office level (local, state, federal)
    - Includes digital infrastructure and communication tools
    - Standardized advertising allocations across media platforms

- **Small-Donor Matching:**
    - 6:1 or 8:1 matching for small donations (e.g., under $200)
    - Only in-district donations eligible for matching
    - Real-time verification system to prevent gaming


## Strict Lobbying Regulations

### Registration and Transparency
- **Mandatory Registration:**
    - All lobbyists must register in a public database
    - Regular reporting of activities and expenditures
    - Clear identification when meeting with officials

### Contribution Limits
- **Zero Corporate Contributions:**
    - Complete ban on corporate money in politics
    - No "dark money" through PACs or super PACs
    - Elimination of Citizens United through constitutional amendment

### Cooling-Off Periods
- **Revolving Door Prevention:**
    - 5-year waiting period before officials can become lobbyists
    - Lifetime ban on lobbying for certain high-level positions
    - Strict enforcement through the Constitutional Enforcement Unit

### Activity Restrictions
- **Limited Access:**
    - No private meetings between lobbyists and officials
    - All interactions must be recorded and publicly available
    - Ban on gifts, travel, or other perks from lobbyists


## Universal Transparency

### Real-Time Disclosure
- **Digital Tracking System:**
    - Blockchain-based platform for all political spending
    - Real-time reporting of contributions and expenditures
    - Public API for third-party monitoring tools

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **What Must Be Disclosed:**
    - Direct campaign contributions
    - Independent expenditures
