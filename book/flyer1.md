## Are You Ready for Change?

Imagine a society where:
- **Everyone’s voice matters.**
- **Government decisions are transparent and accountable.**
- **Technology is harnessed for the public good—not to control or surveil.**

Democracy 2.0 is our blueprint to build that future. It’s a bold vision that puts people at the center, protects our rights, and adapts to tomorrow’s challenges.

## Our Core Pillars

### **Universal Human Rights & DEI**
- **Inclusive Governance:** Ensuring equality, diversity, and inclusion for every citizen.
- **Rights You Can Trust:** Protecting the freedoms and dignity of all, regardless of background.

### **Fair & Sustainable Labor**
- **30-Hour Work Week:** Promoting a healthier work-life balance.
- **6 Weeks Paid Vacation & Mandatory Sabbaticals:** Guaranteeing time for rest, renewal, and personal growth.
- **A Living Wage for All:** Wait staff and all workers receive salaries that truly support a decent standard of living—no more relying on tips.

### **Mandatory Youth Service**
- **2 Years of Service Work:** Young people engage in meaningful work, both overseas and in diverse communities at home, to build empathy, skills, and civic responsibility.

### **Future-Proofing Against AI & Technology Risks**
- **AI Ethics Oversight:** Ensuring AI works for us—all while preventing mass surveillance, corporate control, or political manipulation.
- **Worker Protection in Automation:** As new technologies emerge, displaced workers receive ongoing training, financial support, and new job opportunities.
- **Decentralized Data Ownership:** You own your personal data, preventing exploitation by governments or corporations.
