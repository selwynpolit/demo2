## Enforcing Accountability for Political Dishonesty

Politicians lying undermines trust and democracy itself. Democracy 2.0 should have **clear, enforceable consequences** for dishonesty in public office. Here’s how we could address it:

### **1. Automatic Accountability Mechanisms**
- **Truth Verification System**: All public statements by politicians are **fact-checked in real time** by independent oversight bodies. Lies are flagged immediately.
- **Mandatory Public Apologies**: If a politician is caught lying, they must issue a **formal, public apology** within 48 hours.
- **Financial Penalties**: Lies that mislead the public or cause harm result in **automatic fines**, paid directly from the politician’s personal assets.

### **2. Removal from Office for Severe Dishonesty**
- **Three-Strike Rule**: Politicians caught lying **three times** about major issues are **automatically removed from office**.
- **Immediate Expulsion for Harmful Lies**: If a lie causes **significant public harm** (e.g., economic damage, health risks), the politician is **immediately disqualified** from holding office.

### **3. Criminal Charges for Intentional Deception**
- **Legal Consequences for Fraudulent Lies**: Politicians who knowingly spread false information to **manipulate elections or policy** face **criminal prosecution**.
- **Lifetime Ban from Public Office**: Severe offenders are permanently barred from running for any government position.

### **4. Public Oversight & Transparency**
- **Citizen-Led Truth Panels**: Independent citizen groups review political statements and **hold leaders accountable** for dishonesty.
- **Digital Truth Tracker**: A public platform records all political statements, ensuring lies are **permanently documented** for voters to see.

### **5. Restitution for Harmed Citizens**
- **Compensation for Public Harm**: If a politician’s lies lead to **economic or health-related damage**, affected citizens receive **automatic reparations** funded by the politician’s party.

This system ensures that lying isn’t just unethical—it’s politically and personally catastrophic. Should we refine these repercussions further?
