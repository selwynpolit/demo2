## Overview

The origins of this online books come from a chat session with Copilot on Wednesday April 23, 2025.  These were my prompts:

Do you have access to project 2025 from the heritage foundation?

I can certainly discuss Project 2025 and its ideas. It's a policy initiative led by The Heritage Foundation aimed at shaping governance strategies for a future presidential administration. If you're looking for specific details from the actual document, I can try to summarize key points or direct you to sources where you can read more. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

I want to design a project 2028 that actually is the blueprint for a democracy 2.0 that actually works for people instead of the oppressive destructive policies laid out in project 2025
