## Mission

To reimagine governance as a transparent, inclusive, and equitable open-source ecosystem—supporting an adaptive democratic process through digital accessibility, regenerative design, and sustained public engagement.

## Genesis

This project was born out of deep concern for the future of democratic governance in the face of authoritarian drift and systemic inequity. In reaction to ideologies that consolidate control and undermine democratic institutions, exemplified by [Project 2025](https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf) that threaten to erode civil liberties and consolidate power among the privileged few, **Democracy 2.0** emerged as a proactive alternative. Rather than merely reacting to the chaos and disinformation that floods our civic ecosystem, this initiative seeks to build something visionary: a north star for reimagining governance from the ground up.

As an open-source software developer, environmentalist, permaculturist, and immigrant from South Africa, the creator behind this project brings a unique lens—one rooted in regeneration, interdependence, and lived experience. This isn’t just a political response; it’s a blueprint for freedom, dignity, sustainability, and accountability. It’s also a call to design governance systems that are *robust, transparent, and resilient to corruption*—so that power can no longer hide behind complexity or serve only the few.

Everyone is invited (from policymakers to everyday citizens) to explore, remix, and contribute to a more participatory, adaptive, and equitable democratic process. By integrating [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) collaboration, [Permaculture ethics](/core_values#permaculture-based-ethics), and digital accessibility, **Democracy 2.0** aims to prototype governance models that nourish both people and planet—systems built not just to function, but to endure with integrity.

This started with a [chat session with Microsoft Copilot](guts.md) beginning on Saturday, April 19, 2025.

## Why open source?
Open source is more than just a development methodology; it’s a philosophy that embodies transparency, collaboration, and community ownership. Open source accelerates progress, encourages diverse contributions, and ensures accountability. By making our work publicly accessible, we invite scrutiny, improvement, and broad participation.


## Big-Picture Objectives

**Democracy 2.0** aims to cultivate a new civic infrastructure—an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), community-driven framework for governance that is transparent by default, regenerative by design, and resilient against authoritarian capture.

At its heart, this project seeks systemic transformation: to move beyond outdated, centralized models and into a more participatory, equitable paradigm. By prototyping tools and processes rooted in [Permaculture ethics](/core_values#permaculture-based-ethics), digital accessibility, and public co-creation, Democracy 2.0 envisions:

-  **Governance as a Commons**: Not something bestowed from above, but stewarded collectively.
-  **Feedback-Rich Systems**: Structured for adaptability, responsiveness, and iterative learning.
-  **Modular Adaptability**: A flexible architecture that communities can localize, remix, and evolve to fit their own contexts.
-  **Structural Resistance to Corruption**: Designed with transparency and accountability baked in—not as afterthoughts, but as foundations.

Ultimately, Democracy 2.0 isn’t just an experiment. It’s a roadmap for how governance could serve the many not the few by redistributing both power and participation.



## Community Stewardship: Handing It Over

Democracy 2.0 isn’t a solo project. Ultimately, it will need to be powered by a community. We’ll form a small, rotating Steering Council to guide the big picture and create Working Groups focused on areas like UX, accessibility, and anti-corruption. An Open Governance Charter will lay out how we make decisions, resolve conflicts, and stay true to our values, while simple onboarding guides and mentor pairings help anyone jump in and contribute. This friendly, layered approach spreads responsibility, keeps us accountable, and makes sure our framework stays fresh, fair, and responsive to everyone’s needs.

Our next steps will be to host a Launch jam to start building our first steering council and perhaps working groups.  We need to build a community of people who are passionate about creating a better democracy and who want to contribute their skills and ideas to this project.

## Iteration Process

Democracy 2.0 is not a static blueprint, but a living, evolving framework. It will advance through iterative cycles, with regular reviews (of design, testing and feedback) and opportunities for community input. Each phase will be documented and refined based on stakeholder feedback.
